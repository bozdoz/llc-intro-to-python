# You are given a list of years in which people were born
#
# Use variables, for loops, and if statements to complete the following tasks

birth_years = [2002, 1985, 2007, 1963, 1982, 1976, 
    2006, 2010, 1994, 1992, 1971, 1994, 2000, 1991, 
    1961, 1984, 2003, 2006, 1998, 1981, 1962, 2007]

# change current year as needed
current_year = 2018

# Task 1: count how many people are more than (hint: greater than) 50 years old
#
# ex: if you were born in 1990, and the current year is 2018, then 
# subtracting 1990 from 2018 gives us 28 years.



# Task 2: count how many people are more than (hint: greater than) 
# 20 years old and less than 30 years old



# Bonus: what is the average age of this list of people?
